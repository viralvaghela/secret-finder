**Secret Finder** is a command-line tool designed to rapidly scan decompiled Android applications for hardcoded secrets. It moves beyond simple keyword searching by using a powerful regex engine to identify high-entropy strings, specific key patterns, and other sensitive data that could pose a security risk.

The output is a beautiful, self-contained HTML report that provides a clear, actionable overview of all findings, helping developers and security auditors quickly identify and remediate potential vulnerabilities.

## üåü Key Features

* **üéØ High-Precision Regex Engine:** Utilizes a comprehensive library of over 40 regex patterns to accurately detect private keys, API keys (AWS, Google, Stripe), OAuth tokens, database URIs, and much more.
* **‚ö°Ô∏è Blazing Fast Scans:** Leverages multiprocessing to scan files in parallel, drastically reducing analysis time on multi-core systems.
* **üìä Interactive Dashboard:** Generates a professional HTML report with interactive charts, a sortable findings table, and in-line code context previews.
* **üéöÔ∏è Severity Ranking:** Classifies findings as **Critical**, **High**, **Medium**, or **Low** to help you prioritize the most dangerous exposures first.
* **‚öôÔ∏è Simple & Flexible:** Easy-to-use CLI with options for a quick basic scan or a comprehensive deep scan of all files.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/viralvaghela/secret-finder.git](https://github.com/viralvaghela/secret-finder.git)
    cd secret-finder
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Download `apktool.jar`:**
    *(Ensure `apktool.jar` is available in your PATH or the project directory).*

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

Using the tool is straightforward. Point it at your target APK file and choose your scan level via the interactive prompt.

```sh
$ python secret_finder.py

Welcome to the Secret Finder!

Enter the path to the APK file: path/to/your/app.apk

Select file check option:
[1] Basic Scan (Fast - Checks AndroidManifest.xml and strings.xml)
[2] Advanced Scan (Slow - Checks all decompiled files)
Enter your choice (1 or 2): 2
```

* **Basic Scan:** A quick check of the most common locations for hardcoded secrets. Ideal for a fast, initial assessment.
* **Advanced Scan:** A comprehensive analysis that decompiles the entire APK and scans every single file. Recommended for deep security audits.

## üìÑ Sample Report

After a scan is complete, a report file named `security_report_<apk_name>.html` will be generated in the root directory.

The interactive report allows you to:
* View a summary of findings with charts.
* See the distribution of secrets by severity and type.
* Sort, filter, and search through all findings.
* Click a finding to view the exact line of code where the secret was found.
* Copy the secret value or file path directly to your clipboard.
